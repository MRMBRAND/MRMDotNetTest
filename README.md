# MRM Brand .Net excercise

MRM deals with many companies and handles a lot of product data.

Your job will be to build a very simple product database API.

In this repository you will find a JSON file: `product.json` with some product data. Each product will have the following fields:

```json
{
  "name": "",
  "description": "",
  "categoryId": 1
}
```

You will also find a JSON file with categories in it `category.json`. Each entry in this file will have the following structure:

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "title": "Wines"
}
```
